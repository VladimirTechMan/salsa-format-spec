SALSA Format 0.8 Specification
==============================

**Author: Vladimir "*VladimirTechMan*" Beloborodov**, \<VladimirTechMan@gmail.com\>

##*Abstract*

*This document is a description of the Simple Application-Level-Signaling Archive (SALSA) format that can be used to easily log, annotate, exchange and process packet flows of different signaling protocols that are used in modern web- or VoIP-applications. SALSA is a JSON-based format and is aimed at providing easier interoperability, extensibility, and at allowing to efficiently create and process signaling logs on the application level, where the usage of more traditional binary-based packet capture formats, like PCAP or PcapNG, can be difficult, impractical, or even impossible.*

##1 Motivation behind proposing the SALSA format

Network traces can be collected and examined with dedicated tools like Wireshark and stored using special file formats, such as PCAP or PcapNG. These formats allow to capture a very precise and detailed picture about what was going on at all the levels of networking stack, up from the data-link layer, at a particular network point and during a specific period of time. Unfortunately, in many practical cases, the necessity to unwrap and re-assemble information from lower-level protocols and to deal with all-binary format structure of those files largely prevent new applications and tools from being able to easily and efficiently create and process such files themselves. Some major issues related to that are as follows:

* The traffic coming between endpoints is typically encrypted. Thus, trying to capture details somewhere outside the actual applications that send and receive data does not help in checking the actual signaling packets exchanged over a secured channel.
* For many real-time communication applications, archiving with PCAP or similar packet capture formats may be impossible or not feasible. That is especially true for web applications and cleints, as well as for mobile applications.
* Existing libraries (especially open-source ones) that are intended to read PCAP and similar file formats often fail to correctly handle the TCP message framing and thus cannot properly re-assemble the application-level signaling protocol packets.

Some communication applications and diagnostic tools offer embedded machanisms in them, to log details about signaling packets being exchanged. But such mechanisms are usually not specifically tailored for packet archiving and they often mix those details with many other debug or informational printouts. In addition, those logs usually come in some custom, incompatible formats. Thus, a good interoperability in handling them between third-party applications is problematic.

With all those and some other practical needs in mind, the Simple Application-Level-Signaling Archive (SALSA) format is proposed. It is a simple, concise JSON-based format that aims at making it easy to create and annotate, parse and process packet data. Using SALSA, individuals and companies can be better equipped to create different types of handy engineering tools, like those for call-flow visualizations or automatic test script generation. And such tools, handling specific signaling protocols, can now become much more compatible with each other and with the signaling libraries and components of client-side and server-side communication applications.

The SALSA format is largely agnostic to the actual protocol type(s) and details about the packets archived. It may be used to archive call and session signaling, media signaling, or domain-specific signaling types (for example, signaling payloads used for monitoring or control of remote objects) â€” and the format allows to deal with multiple types of protocols at once. If the users of SALSA need to add their own custom details, to make the basic format more protocol-aware or to tailor it to their spcific needs, they can do that using the "extras" mechanism available in SALSA. 

###1.1 Comparison to HTTP Archive (HAR) format

SALSA may resemble some people the HTTP Archive (HAR) format, at a high-level. Actually, SALSA was partly inspired by HAR. But HAR was created largely with the HTTP-protocol specifics in mind. And it is tailored for HTTP, and not towards capturing and handling traces of arbitrary text-based or binary protocols used by VoIP and web-applications. Thus, HAR covers different practical needs, compared to the purposes of SALSA described in section 1.

##2 Conformance requirements

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in the normative parts of this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.

Requirements phrased in the imperative as part of algorithms (such as "strip any leading space characters" or "return false and abort these steps") are to be interpreted with the meaning of the key word ("must", "should", "may", etc) used in introducing the algorithm.

Some conformance requirements are phrased as requirements on attributes, methods or objects. Such requirements are to be interpreted as requirements on user agents.

Conformance requirements phrased as algorithms or specific steps may be implemented in any manner, so long as the end result is equivalent.

##3 Terminology and Definitions

* The construction "a Foo object", where Foo is actually an interface, is sometimes used instead of the more accurate "an object implementing the interface Foo".

* The construction "SALSA file" is used throughout this document in the sense "a file properly created and formatted according to the SALSA specification".

* __SALSA file creator.__ An application or a software component (library, module, web service, etc.) that produces a ready file conformant with all the requirement of this specification. Please, note that a SALSA file creator is not necessarily doing the actual packet logging activities. For example, it may instead be a tool convering existing packet capture files (represented, for example, in a binary format like PCAP or PcapNG) into the SALSA format. It may also be a tool to re-format, or merge together, or filter existing files in the SALSA format.

* __Packet logger.__ An application or a software component (library, module, web service, etc.) that does the actual logging (either complete capturing and sniffing, or just "dumping") of the network packets to be, eventually, archived in a file using the SALSA format. Please, note that a packet logger does not necessarily create ready files in the SALSA format. It may instead save the results in some other format that a SALSA file creator will later read and then create a SALSA-formatted file based on it. It may also be directly passing the packets being logged to a SALSA file creator for further processing (for example, using module APIs inside one application, or over some system-level or network-level connection mechanisms).

* __SALSA file consumer.__ An application or a software component (library, module, web service, etc.) that is able to read files in the SALSA format and then handle, in some way, the information contained in those files. Typically, a SALSA file consumer does not have the functions of SALSA file creator or packet logger. But in specific cases it may include some of them too (for example, think of a utility to re-format, merge together, or filter existing SALSA files).

* __UTC.__ Coordinated Universal Time as maintained by the Bureau International des Poids et Mesures (BIPM).

##4 The SALSA format

The SALSA format is based on JSON, as described in RFC 4627.

###4.1 Encoding

A SALSA file is REQUIRED to be saved in UTF-8 encoding. Other encodings are forbidden. A SALSA file consumer MUST ignore a byte-order mark if it exists in the file, and a SALSA file creator MAY emit a byte-order UTF-8 mark in the file.

###4.2 List of objects

####4.2.1 salsa

This object represents the root of the exported data. This object MUST be present and its name MUST be "salsa". The object contains the following name/value pairs:

  JSON Name  |JSON Type| Description
 ------------|---------|------------
 "packets"   | array   | Required. An array of objects of type "packet", where each object represents a logged signaling protocol packet.
 "protocol"  | string  | Optional. The name of the protocol being represented by all the entries in the "packets" array. Applicable only when the protocol is the same for all packets.
 "transport" | string  | Optional. The name of the transport mechanism being used to exchange all the packets represented by the "packets" array. Applicable only when all packets have the same transport.
 "startedDateTime" | string | Optional. The timestamp of the moment when the packet logging activity actually started. The value is formatted according to a subset of formats defined in ISO 8601 (*see details below*).
 "duration"  | string  | Optional. Total duration of the packet logging activity, in seconds.
 "geolocation" | object | Optional. The geographical position (coordinates) where the packets were logged by packet logger and the accuracy of representation.
 "version"   | string  | Required. Version number of the SALSA format used for the given file.
 "creator"   | object  | Optional. An object of type creator that contains the information about SALSA file creator.
 "comment"   | string  | Optional. A comment provided by the user or the application.
 "extras"    | array   | Optional. An array of objects of type "extra" that contain any vendor- or protocol-specific additional details that the SALSA format itself cannot or does not support.

####*4.2.1.1 "startedDateTime"*

A SALSA file creator SHOULD provide the "startedDateTime" value. For a specific SALSA-formatted file, the "startedDateTime" string value MUST represent the moment when the packet logging activity started. (Note that in the case of converting existing packet capture files to the SALSA format, the timestamps MUST be for when the packets in those source files where logged, not for the time frame when the conversion was performed itself.) In the simplest case, that moment is equal to when the first packet was actually logged by the application. But it may also be earlier on the timeline, for example, if the application was waiting for some time before it actually received and logged the first signaling packet.

Whenever the "startedDateTime" value is provided in the file, all the individual "time" values of "packet" objects, in the "packets" array, MUST be relative to that "startedDateTime" value. When the "startedDateTime" value cannot be known, the SALSA file creator MAY still provide the "time" values for "packet" objects relative to the moment when the packet logging was actually started (for example, when converting to the SALSA format from an existing capture file in a format that provides that relative timing information in it, but not the absolute start time of the logging activity). If the SALSA file creator has no possibility to determine the time stamps of individual packets relative to the moment when the logging activity was started, then it MUST assume that moment to be equal to the moment when the first packet was actually logged (and, thus, the "time" value of that first packet object in the "packets" array will be zero).

The "startedDateTime" string value, when provided, MUST be formatted in accordance with the ISO 8601 format for combined date and time, with explicit delimiters between all the date and time unit components, and it MUST include seconds as its smallest time unit provided. The seconds value SHOULD also include, at least, thousandth fractions, to support the millisecond precision. It it RECOMMENDED to provide extra digits to the fractional part, to support a sub-millisecond precision, when that is possible. The SALSA file creator MAY add the time zone information, in accordance to ISO 8601 specifications, when it is directly available or can be easily determined by the file creator. Otherwise, the "startedDateTime" string value specifies the local time on the system where the packets were logged. When indicating a time zone, in a file compliant with this version of SALSA format spec, the offset from UTC MUST be specified in one of the following forms, as appropriate: "+hh:mm", "-hh:mm", or "Z". (The "Z" value is used in ISO 8601 as a short notation for the zero UTC offset and is semantically equivalent to "+00:00".) Thus, the format of "startedDateTime" string value MUST be "YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss.sss" when representing a local time (for example, "2013-10-22T17:18:30.457") and it MUST be "YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss.sssTZD" when representing a global time, relative to UTC (for example, "2013-10-22T17:18:30.457+03:00" or "2013-10-22T14:18:30.457Z"; note that these two example values represent the same global time). Please, note that, according to the ISO 8601 specification, value "-00:00" is not allowed and thus it MUST NOT be used in SALSA-formatted files. Other possible formats declared in ISO 8601 for specifying time zones MUST NOT be used in SALSA. (That and other restrictions given above on the format of "startedDateTime" are for the sake of easier parsing and formatting SALSA files.)

The usage of ISO 8601-compliant format, as opposed to a numeric value equal to the absolute clock time on the system, is intentional in SALSA: It allows for more compatibility between different systems when doing some calendar calculations, even basic ones. (The absolute time values on a system are normally relative to some predefined epoch and different systems may have different epoch "starting points". Thus, a more portable approach is beneficial.) Also, the possible string formats specified above are much easier to understand for a person checking a SALSA-formatted file with a plain text editor.

Please, note that a global time point can be correctly represented using any of the available time zone offsets. For example, many platforms allow to easily get an ISO-formatted time value that is compliant with the above requirements and is adjusted to UTC (that is, it has a zero time zone offset). Thus, the SALSA file consumer SHOULD NOT use the time offset information as an evidence of the geographical location (an area or region) where the packet logger performed its logging activity. Instead, when the geolocation information is available and the SALSA file creator is allowed to provide it in the file, the geographical position of the packet logger MUST always be conveyed by means of the "geolocation" object.

####*4.2.1.2 "duration"*

The "duration" value, if added by the SALSA file creator, MUST be equal to the total duration, in seconds, of the packet logging activity (starting from the moment represented by the "startedDateTime" value). The numeric equivalent of the "duration" string value MUST be equal to or greater than the numeric equivalent of the "time" string value of the last "packet" object in the "packets" array.

The SALSA file creator SHOULD handle and output all the duration values, at least, up to their thousandth fractions, to support the millisecond precision. It is RECOMMENDED to provide extra digits to the fractional part, to support a sub-millisecond precision, when that is possible. The value of "duration" MUST be a string representation of the numeric value of logging activity duration and it MUST only contain digits (0-9) and, optionally, one dot character (.) to delimit the integer part and the fractional part of the numeric value. (For the explanation on utilizing the JSON string type versus the number type, to represent relative timing values in SALSA, please, refer to section 4.2.3, to the part discussing the "time" value of the "packet" object.)

Providing the "duration" value is RECOMMENDED in the cases where the packet logging activity did not immediately finish at the moment when the last packet (represented in the "packets" array) was logged and the fact that there was no other signaling packets between that last logged packet and the actual end of the packet logging activity can be useful, as an extra piece of information, to the SALSA file consumers.

####*4.2.1.3 "transport" and "protocol"*

For the sake of compatibility, all string values for "protocol" and "transport" MUST be in the lower case. For specific requirements and recommendations on naming the "protocol" entries, please, refer to section 4.3.

For the "transport" entry, the following values are suggested in this version of the SALSA format: "udp", "tcp", "websocket", "webrtc-datachannel". Please, note that in this case the transport name is not necessarily limited to the actual transport protocol being used (as "udp" and "tcp" are, for example), but may also reflect the actual mechanism being used to exchange the signaling packets (for instance, "websocket", which is built on top of TCP, or "webrtc-datachannel", which is essentially SCTP over UDP). (Going forward, more values may be added. For example, it is not clear yet if adding "tls" and "dtls", to augment more general "tcp" and "udp" transports, would be beneficial for practical purposes of SALSA.)

Providing the "protocol" entry in the "salsa" object is RECOMMENDED in case if all the packets represented by objects inside the "packets" array belong to the same signaling protocol. Providing the "transport" entry in the "salsa" object is RECOMMENDED in case if all the packets represented by objects inside the "packets" array are exchanged over the same transport mechanism. When the "protocol" entry or the "transport" entry in the "salsa" object is provided, the SALSA file creator SHOULD NOT provide the corresponding individual "protocol" or "transport" entries in the "packet" objects inside the "packets" array.

The SALSA file creator SHOULD specify the "transport" and "protocol" values whenever that information is readily available or can be determined sufficiently quickly (that is, without notably affecting the expected responsiveness characteristics of the application).

####4.2.2 creator

This object contains information about the SALSA file creator and it contains the following name/value pairs:

  JSON Name|JSON Type| Description
 ----------|---------|------------
 "name"    | string  | Required. The name of the SALSA file creator that produced the given SALSA file.
 "version" | string  | Required. The version number of the SALSA file creator that produced the given SALSA file.
 "comment" | string  | Optional. A comment provided by the user or the application.

####4.2.3 geolocation

This object contains information about the geographical position where the packets represented in the given SALSA file were originally collected by packet logger.

  JSON Name  |JSON Type| Description
 ------------|---------|------------
 "latitude"  | number  | Required. The latitude of the position, in decimal degrees.
 "longitude" | number  | Required. The longitude of the position, in decimal degrees.
 "accuracy"  | number  | Required. The accuracy of position with latitude and longitude values.
 "altitude"  | number  | Optional. The altitude of the position, in meters above the mean sea level.
 "altitudeAccuracy" | number  | Optional. The altitude accuracy of position, in meters.

All values of "accuracy" and "altitudeAccuracy" MUST be non-negative real numbers.

####4.2.4 packets

The "packets" array represents logged signaling packets. Each "packet" object has the following name/value pairs:

  JSON Name  |JSON Type| Description
 ------------|---------|------------
 "time"      | string  | Required. Packet logging time, in seconds, relative to the moment when the packet logging activity was started.
 "protocol"  | string  | Optional. The name of the signaling protocol of the packet.
 "transport" | string  | Optional. The name of the transport that was used to transmit the packet.
 "src"       | object  | Required. The identification details of the source (sender) of the packet.
 "dst"       | object  | Required. The identification details of the destination (receiver) of the packet.
 "format"    | string  | Optional. The format of the "body" entry in the current "packet" object. If omitted, "plain-text" MUST be assumed and used.
 "body"      | *depending on "format" specified* | Required. The actual data of archived signaling packet, represented according to the specified "format".
 "comment"   | string  | Optional. A comment provided by the user or the application about the packet itself or about the part of interaction between source and destination that the packet is used for.
 "extras"    | array   | Optional. An array of objects of type "extra" that contain any vendor- or protocol-specific additional details that the SALSA format itself cannot or does not support.

The SALSA file creator SHOULD order (sort) all "packet" objects inside the "packets" array according to the numerical equivalents of "time" string values in these objects, starting from the smallest value (that is, from the oldest packet).

A SALSA file consumer MUST always ensure that the "packet" objects in the "packets" array are ordered (sorted) as required for its purposes.

####*4.2.4.1 "time"*

The "time" value in a "packet" object MUST be calculated relative to the moment when the logging activity was started. That way, when the SALSA file creator provides the "startedDateTime" value in the "salsa" object, the SALSA file consumers can easily calculate the absolute timestamps of individual packets, if required. On the other hand, even if the "startedDateTime" value is not provided in the file (for example, because it was not available from the original packet capture format that was converted to the SALSA format), the relative values will still be available and will give the information necessary to analyze relative timing characteristics.

The "time" values MUST be in seconds. The SALSA file creator SHOULD handle and output all the time values, at least, up to their thousandth fractions, to support the millisecond precision. It is RECOMMENDED to provide extra digits to the fractional part, to support a sub-millisecond precision, when that is possible. The "time" string value MUST only contain digits (0-9) and, optionally, one dot character (.) to delimit the integer part and the fractional part of the numeric value.

The SALSA format uses a string representation of timestamps, rather than the number type available in the JSON format. That is intentional, for two reasons:
* It allows for better control over the formatting of the timestamps with a millisecond or sub-millisecond precision (that is, with a fractional part in them): Some of the available libraries that read and write the JSON format tend to support only a fixed (and non-configurable) maximum number of digits in a fractional part, which may be insufficient for parsing or saving the timestamps in SALSA file creators or consumers based on those libraries.
* It allows for more flexibility in dealing with longer integer and floating-point numeric values on the architectures and in some (typically, older) programming languages where the basic numeric type(s) do not provide a sufficient value range to hold such numeric values in them without a representation error.

####*4.2.4.2 "transport" and "protocol"*

The SALSA file creator SHOULD specify a "protocol" value for each "packet" object, unless it has specified the "protocol" value in the "salsa" object (which signals that all packets in the SALSA file represent the same protocol). When the "protocol" value in the "salsa" object is specified, the SALSA file creator SHOULD NOT specify the "protocol" value for each packet.

For specific requirements and recommendations on naming the "protocol" entries, please, refer to section 4.3.

The SALSA file creator SHOULD specify a "transport" value for each "packet" object, unless it has specified the "transport" value in the "salsa" object (which signals that all the packets are transmitted over the same transport mechanism). When the "transport" value in the "salsa" object is specified, the SALSA file creator SHOULD NOT specify the "transport" value for each packet.

For some more general considerations and requirements on "transport" and "protocol" check section 4.2.1.3

####*4.2.4.3 "format" and "body"*

In the current version of SALSA, the "format" string MUST have one of the following three possible values: "base64", "plain-text", or "plain-text-chunks". The "format" string is optional: When it is not provided for a "packet" object, the "base64" value MUST be assumed by default.

The value of "format" string defines how the contents of the "body" string was encoded by the SALSA file creator and how a SALSA file consumer needs to decode it. The meaning of the format option values is as follows:

* "base64": This option is suitable for any textual or binary protocol packet formats. The "body" value in the "packet" object MUST be a string that represents all the bytes from the original packet body encoded using base64, as described in RFC 4648.
* "plain-text": This option MAY be used only when the original packet body (text) is encoded using UTF-8. The "body" value in the "packet" object MUST be a UTF-8-encoded string compliant with all the requirements to the string type of the JSON format (RFC 4627). This string value MUST be equal to the result of taking the original UTF-8-encoded packet body (text) and properly escaping all Unicode characters that cannot be directly represented with the JSON string type (refer to RFC 4627 for details).
* "plain-text-chunks": This format option MAY be used only when the original packet body (text) is encoded using UTF-8. The "body" value in the "packet" object MUST be an array of strings ("chunks" of the packet body text), each of which is properly encoded with UTF-8 and compliant with the requirements to the string type of the JSON format (RFC 4627). The concatenation of all those strings, in the order that they have inside the array, MUST be equal to the result of taking the original UTF-8-encoded packet body (text) and properly escaping all Unicode characters that cannot be directly represented with the JSON string type (refer to RFC 4627 for details).

The SALSA file creator MAY use either "plain-text" or "plain-text-chunks" if the body of the packet is guaranteed, from the application context or in some other way, to have a valid UTF-8 encoding or if there is a sufficiently quick way to verify that it has a valid UTF-8 encoding. For all other situations, the SALSA file creator MUST use the "base64" format option to represent the packet body in the SALSA file.

When the usage of "plain-text" and "plain-text-chunks" format options is applicable, it is up to the SALSA file creator implementation or the end user's preferences to decide which of the two format options to use. In general, whenever a more compact representation of SALSA file is desireable, it is RECOMMENDED to use the "plain-text" format. Using the "plain-text-chunks" format is mostly helpful when the target end users of the SALSA file need to be able to directly inspect (read) it as a plain text file (for example, using a basic text editor or viewer). For that purpose, it is additionally RECOMMENDED to split the original packet body into a sequence of strings ("chunks") so that each string matches a separate line in the original packet body and is explicitly finished by the known end-of-line (EOL) character sequence, if any, defined in the specification of the corresponding signaling protocol.

####4.2.5 src and dst

The "src" object identifies the source (sender) of signaling protocol packet. The "dst" object identifies the destination (receiver) of signaling protocol packet. They both have the same format, with the following name/value pairs:

  JSON Name|JSON Type| Description
 ----------|---------|------------
 "name"    | string  | Required. The symbolic name of the signaling packet sender (for the "src" object) or receiver (for the "dst" object).
 "ipaddr"  | string  | Optional. The IP address, if applicable and known, of the signaling packet sender or receiver.
 "port"    | number  | Optional. The TCP/UDP/SCTP port, if applicable and known, of the signaling packet sender or receiver.
 "extras"    | array   | Optional. An array of objects of type "extra" that contain any vendor- or protocol-specific additional details that the SALSA format itself cannot or does not support.

The "name" string value MUST be encoded in UTF-8. The SALSA file creator MUST provide it for each "src" and "dst" object in the file. The "name" value MUST be unique for every distinct network socket used for sending or receiving packets and reflected in the file. (For the purposes of this document, the term "network socket" is used in its generic sense, as "an endpoint of an inter-process communication flow inside a computer system or across a computer network".)

In addition to being a unique identifier of distinct packet senders and receivers, the "name" value MAY also serve the purpose of better documenting/annotating the actual functions (roles) of those individual senders and receivers. (For example, a convenient human-readable custom naming approach can be established and consistently applied.) Note that the users of a SALSA file MAY change or extend those unique names (annotations) at any later point in time, by completely replacing an existing unique name with a more descriptive one, which MUST still be unique in the updated file.

When the captured application-level signaling goes over IP network socket(s), and the IP address or port are known to the SALSA file creator, or they can be determined sufficiently quickly, the SALSA file creator SHOULD provide the corresponding "ipaddr" and "port" values in the corresponding "src" and "dst" objects. The "ipaddr" string value MUST be formatted according to the standard dotted decimal representation for IPv4 addresses, and according to the string formats recommended in RFC 5952 for IPv6 addresses. The "port" value MUST be a positive integer numeric value.

If the "ipaddr" and "port" values are known, and there is no better naming scheme available, the "name" string value SHOULD be a combination of the "ipaddr" and "port" values with an appropriate formatting applied to them. For example, in case of IPv4 the name MAY be formatted like "192.168.34.17:5070" and in case of IPv6 (like "[1fff:0:a88:85a3::ac1f]:80"z in case of IPv6) .

####4.2.6 extras

The "extras" array entry is optional and it MAY be added by the SALSA file creator to several other standard objects defined by the SALSA format. This notion of "extras" in SALSA exists to enable the users of the format to further customize and tailor it, to their specific needs.

The "extras" array contains a set of "extra" objects, each of which provides some additional information in the scope of a given SALSA file. The actual ordering of those objects inside the array is not defined and is not important, for the purpose of the current version of SALSA spec. All the custom details from the objects inside a specific "extras" array MUST be relevant in, and related to, the scope of a higher-level JSON object that directly contains this specific "extras" array in it.

Aside from the requirements explicitly given in this SALSA specification, including the current section, the actual contents and semantics of individual "extra" objects in an "extras" array is completely outside the scope of this document. It is the responsibility of the organizations or individuals adding their own (custom) "extra" objects to SALSA files to define or re-define, and to properly create and handle the actual format and contents of those objects. It is up to such organizations and individuals to decide if they want to provide any formal specifications of their custom "extra" object(s) to the public. But it is advisable to do so, as that practice may help external users to get more useful details from the customized SALSA files that they receive. In addition, if some specific detail(s) start to appear in many customized SALSA files used in the field, that itself may signal a need to consider and provide a corresponding generic mechanism, to express those details, in the core SALSA format specification.

Any "extra" object MUST comply with the following requirements to its specific key/value pairs:

  JSON Name|JSON Type| Description
 ----------|---------|------------
 "name"    | string  | Required. Provides a unique name identifier for the given "extra" object, in the reverse domain name notation.
 "version" | string  | Optional. The version number of the format of the current "extra" object. The decision and details about using versioning with an "extra" object format are with the people responsible for that format.
 "comment" | string  | Optional. A comment related to the current "extra" object and provided by the user or the application.

Following the general requirements to the SALSA files, any keys and values added inside a custom "extra" object MUST be properly encoded by the SALSA file creator using UTF-8 and comply with the JSON format requirements (RFC 4627).

The "name" value MUST use the reverse domain name notation, which will allow to uniquely identify a specific organization or company (or an individual) that has added a specific "extra" object to the format. The name MAY also include any additional sub-domains, to introduce and identify different types (or sub-types) of "extra" objects used by a given organization.

###4.3 Specifying protocol names in SALSA

The string values for the "protocol" entry, as specified in sections 4.2.1 and 4.2.4 (for the "salsa" and "packet" objects), MUST all be in the lower case.

To achieve better interoperability in handling SALSA files, the following regulations are effective:
* When the protocol is standardized and, thus, it has an established standard protocol name, then SALSA file creators and consumers SHOULD use this name as the string value. (For example, "sip", "xmpp", "json", "http", "sdp", etc.)
* When the protocol is not standardized and the protocol format is unique (that is, it is not based on any other existing signaling protocol, and it is not a variation, or an extension, or a specialization of an exiting protocol, or it is such a modification of the existing protocol that makes it syntactically incompatible with the original one), then the SALSA file creators and consumers aware of that specific protocol MAY use the currently established (maybe, unofficial or internal) protocol name "as is". Note that in this case, often, only these SALSA file creators and consumers will be able to properly handle that protocol's packets in SALSA files. On the other hand, some general tools and services, like those drawing call-flow diagrams, MAY still provide a reasonable handling and representation for the communications using such unknown protocols.
* When the protocol itself is not standardized, but it is based on, or is a variation (extension, specialization) of an existing protocol (whether a standardized one or not) and is backward-compatible with that existing protocol, at least, syntactically. Then it is RECOMMENDED that the SALSA file creators and consumers aware of that specific protocol use an extended protocol naming scheme approach, as follows: "\<base protocol name\>-\<name of custom protocol or specialization\>-\<name of even more custom protocol or specialization\>". The same approach is RECOMMENDED even if the protocol *is* a standardized extension or a variation of another protocol (see some examples on that below).

As an example for the last item in the regulations above, consider a company that uses their own, specific, custom signaling protocol that is based on the JSON format (protocol). Let them call their custom protocol "proFoo". In this case, the recommendation is to avoid using just the "profoo" name when archiving packets of that protocol with SALSA and, instead, to use the "json-profoo" name. That way the SALSA file consumers, even if they are not aware of specific details of the "proFoo" protocol can have a better cue that its basic format is JSON and try to handle the packets of that protocol more specifically (for example, to format and visually represent the packet body contents in the JSON format). While it can definitely be possible to create a number of heuristics for a SALSA file consumer to attempt to intelligently decide on the basic formats and the protocols of individual packets with unknown protocol names in a SALSA file. Still, the naming scheme described above can greatly reduce the complexity and processing time as SALSA file consumers can rely on the suggestions provided with this naming approach.

It is also worth noting that some of the existing specialized signaling protocols already fit into this convention quite naturally. As an example, consider the two common SIP-based protocols for SIP-ISUP interworking, called "SIP-I" and "SIP-T". Shall a SALSA file creator need to archive packets of those protocols, it can use the "sip-i" and "sip-t" protocol names, respectively, in the file. As another example, consider the XML-based and JSON-based approaches to the remote procedure call (RPC) signaling, often named "XML-RPC" and "JSON-RPC". When archiving packets from those RPC protocols with SALSA, using "xml-rpc" and "json-rpc" names would be a recommended approach.

When a SALSA file consumer cannot identify even the basic signaling protocol (format) for an archived packet, it MAY skip the packet. In this case it SHOULD provide an indication or a notification to the end user(s) on the failed attempt to handle that packet. It MAY also ask the user if processing this SALSA file need to be continued. Depending on its functional scope, the SALSA file consumer MAY also try to provide a reasonable high-level handling of a packet for an unknown protocol name (for instance, based on its source and destination details) â€” again, as an example, consider a call-flow visualization tool: It can just draw an appropriate call flow arrow between the source and destination on the diagram and annotate it for the end user with the given protocol name.

Finally, as more tools get support of the SALSA format in them, some of them may offer a more modular approach, where the companies or communities behind certain custom signaling protocols will be able to supply 3rd-party add-ons or extension modules that will enable the tools to recognize and handle those custom protocols in details.

##5 Versioning Scheme

*ATTENTION: The following versioning scheme will be applied when the SALSA format reaches version 1.0. Prior to that, as some major design aspects of the format are still in development, there is a chance that some backward-incompatible changes will be necessary in versions 0.x, to ensure that the format can become stable and practical, and backward-compatible, in versions 1.x.*

The spec number has following syntax:  
\<major-version-number\>.\<minor-version-number\>

Where the major version indicates overall backwards compatibility and the minor version indicates incremental changes. So, any backwardly compatible changes to the spec will result in an increase of the minor version. If an existing fields had to be broken then major version would increase (e.g. 2.0).

Examples:  
1.2 -> 1.3  
1.109 -> 1.110 (in case of 109 more changes)  
1.5 -> 2.0 (2.0 is not compatible with 1.5)  

##6 Privacy

The SALSA format may contain privacy and security sensitive data and in such a case the SALSA file creator SHOULD find some way to notify the end user of this fact before the file is transferred to anyone else.
