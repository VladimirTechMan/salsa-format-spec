####*Hi and welcome to the official repository for SALSA specs and samples.*

A new version of SALSA is in active development now. The format and core concepts behind
it have notably evolved over the past months. You can expect many practical improvements
and enhancements to the format in the coming release â€“ together with the first previews
of open-source libraries and tools that produce and consume SALSA.

####*Updated specs will be published here soon. Thank you for your interest and patience!*
