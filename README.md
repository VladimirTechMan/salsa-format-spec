####*Hi and welcome to the official repository for SALSA specs and samples.*

A new version of SALSA is in active development. The format and core concepts behind
it have notably evolved in the past months and are much more mature now. You can expect
many practical improvements and enhancements to the format in the coming release â€“ 
together with the first previews of open-source libraries and tools that produce and
consume SALSA.

I plan to publish the updated specs and tools on my GitHub account (this one).
If you are interested in SALSA, please, keep your eye on public announcements
about it and visit this repository periodically, for updates.

####*Updated specs will be published here soon. Thank you for your interest and patience!*
